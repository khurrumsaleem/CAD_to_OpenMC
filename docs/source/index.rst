Welcome to The documentation for CAD_to_OpenMC
==============================================
**CAD_to_OpenMC** is a python tool, made to ease the process of
creating OpenMC-ready surface meshes from a CAD-generated representation
of the geometry in the form of a .step (or .stp)-file.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
:doc:`install`.

The fullscale section contains some result from simulation runs with real reactor model
in a scientific context, using models built by CAD to perform reactor simulations.

.. note::

   This project (and its documentation)is under active development.
